Thank you for buying my asset. In the asset there are two variants of animations: the root motion and in place.
 Animator is missing. In the demo scene, you can see animations such as root motion. In another scene, all objects are present. 
In case you want to cut such animations like sleeping, eating and drinking, here is the length of these animations:
- drink, eat,  sleep, agression - 15 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- sit - 25 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- lie - 35 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- hide - 20 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;

The animator controller is made in a primitive form, there is only movement on a plane without controlling the height and bends of the plane. 
Also included in the asset is a simple camera rotation script. 
Rotation of the camera is carried out by pressing the right mouse button, if released, the camera returns to its initial position. 
With the controller script, you can assign some buttons to enable a certain type of animation. 
For the rest, you can easily figure it out, the script is very simple, just like the animator itself. 

Perhaps in the future I will return to the controller and finish it, but for now I lack knowledge :)
